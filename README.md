# ECE5532 - Final Project 

## Using this, the goal is to find out exaclty what will be universal to this project

For example: I will be wokring on what situation while you will work on another. This should highlight stuff that we both will be using and can refer too: vehicle construction and properties, intialization stuff, and maybe stuff relative to recieveing infromation from certain nodes. 

**An idea: Maybe we can create seperate folders called "Ben" and "Sam" where we could store our additions to this project**
