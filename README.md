# ECE5532 - Final Project 

## R3D3: The Mantis Transformation.

Note, the Mantis namespace is still being used to control the kinematics of the robot. The camera and lidar have been slightly moved forward and the caster wheels have been adjusted. The main drivewheels radius and distance apart of not changed.

**An idea: Sam, do you want to work on the part of the IGVC course where you avoid the cones and follow the white line around the track? I will focus specifically on the part of the course where there is random cones and obstacles and no white lines. The robot has to find what gate is open. (The part in the level 2 course thats different from the level 1 course)**
